#Gleam.helper
This is the non-automated version of [Gleam.solver](https://github.com/Citrinate/gleamSolver) that doesn't violate Gleam.io's Terms of Service

This script adds the following features to Gleam.io giveaways:
  * Steam "Join" and "Leave" buttons next to each Steam group entry
  * Twitter "Undo" buttons after completing a Twitter entry
  * Twitch "Unfollow" button after completing a Twitch entry

##Donations

Gleam.io no longer allows [limited Steam accounts](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663), a move which will restrict my ability to continue supporting this script.  If you're feeling generous, please consider making a donation that will go towards future development.  Any games I purchase with your donation will be given away at [SteamGifts.com](https://www.steamgifts.com).
