With v2.0, I've merged this script together with a similar script (marvelousHelper).

If you happened to have both scripts installed, you'll now have 2 copies of "[Giveaway Helper](https://github.com/Citrinate/giveawayHelper)" installed, which will create a doubling effect. You can fix this by uninstalling one of copies.
